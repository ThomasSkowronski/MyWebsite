        <p>This webpage was made using just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. My <a href="https://www.github.com/ThomasSkowronski">GitHub</a>
        contains projects such as an Android app and the projects linked below are some other things that I have created.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Dice Game</h3>

        <p>I made this dice game using Bootstrap and JQuery. It is a simple game where the player tries to get a higher score by rolling the dice. <br>
        If too many 1's are rolled then the round ends with a score of 0. <br>
        I made this webpage to see how the game plays out over a number of turns with different amounts of dice and strikes in the game. <br>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Weight Tracker Android App</h3>

        <p>This Android app allows the user to set a goal for weight loss and track their progress over time. <br>
          The app saves the data about the user with shared preferences and weight entries can be saved along with a picture in order to see progress. <br>
          An SQLite database handles the entries and these can be viewed in chronological order and deleted as well. <br>
